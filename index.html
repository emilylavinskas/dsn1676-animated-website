            <div class="about-panel">
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">General Appearance</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Large, sturdy, well-balanced working dog of substantial bone. Square in appearance from withers to ground and withers to tail set. Heavy-coated with distinctive characteristic markings. In comparison with the opposite sex, dogs appear masculine, bitches feminine without loss of type.</p>
            
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Temperment</p>
                <p class="body-copy">The Bernese temperament is one of the breed's strongest assets. Consistent, dependable, with a strong desire to please. Self-confident, alert, good natured. Attached and loyal to human family; may be aloof or suspicious with strangers, but never sharp or shy. A dog must stand for examination when required to do so by its handler.</p>
                
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Size</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Dogs 24.4 - 27.6 inches (62-70 cm), best size 26 - 26.8 inches (66-68 cm); bitches 22.8 - 26 inches (58-66 cm) best size 23.6 - 24.8 inches (60-63 cm). Height measured at withers. The stocky, well-balanced appearance must be maintained.</p>
                
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Coat &amp; Colour</p>
                <p class="body-copy">The adult coat is thick, moderately long, possibly with a slight wave but never curly. It has a bright natural sheen. In texture it is soft rather than harsh, but is weather resistant, easily kept and resists matting. There is a soft, seasonal undercoat. Compulsory markings: Jet-black ground colour. Rich russet markings (dark reddish brown is most favoured) appear on the cheeks, in a spot over each eye, in a patch above each foreleg, and on all four legs between the black of the upper leg and the white of the feet. Clean white markings as follows: On chest extending uninterrupted to under chin; also a slight- to middle-sized blaze extending into a muzzle band which is not so wide as to obliterate the russet on the cheek (and which preferably does not extend past the corners of the mouth). Preferable markings: White feet with white reaching at the highest the pasterns and a white tip of tail.  Marking should be symmetrical. Too little white is preferable to too much.</p>

            <div class="issues-panel">
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Hip Dysplasia</p>
                <p class="body-copy"> Hip Dysplasia (HD) is perhaps the most widely discussed health challenge in Berners. HD results from an unstable hip socket and subsequent degenerative arthritic changes that result from this instability. HD typically cannot be detected in pups at placement age. HD can affect young puppies but most often leads to a degenerative, sometimes crippling, arthritis as an affected dog ages. Some HD affected dogs will experience no lameness. Some dogs with mild HD may be uncomfortable and other dogs with more severe HD may show no pain or gait problems. For some dogs the disease is completely debilitating and affects dogs from age 6 months to old age. Studies have shown that dogs free of hip dysplasia tend to produce fewer offspring with HD. However, dogs free of hip dysplasia can produce dogs with HD. It is important to know that HD can only be diagnosed by a qualified veterinarianâ€™s evaluation of x-rays of the hip joint. The certifying organizations review the x-rays to determine the presence or likelihood of HD. (OFA determines by arthritic changes and subluxation whether the hips are dysplastic or not, and PennHip measures joint laxity.) Conscientious breeders attempt to reduce the incidence of HD by carefully selecting dogs from families with lower incidences of this disease. Knowing the hip status of as many family members as possible helps breeders select dogs with a greater chance of producing offspring with normal hips. Many breeders require formal hip evaluation of puppies from their breeding programs.</p>
                
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Elbow Dysplasia</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Elbow Dysplasia (ED) is a general term that is used to describe several different abnormalities of the elbow joint. ED is another potentially crippling condition that affects some Berners. A degenerative joint disease like HD, ED causes arthritic changes to occur in the elbow joint. Elbow dysplasia in BMDs is most often a result of fragmented coronoid process, but the ununited anconeal process form of ED and OCD (see below) of the elbow have been seen. Elbow dysplasia can result in lameness and affect puppies as young as 5 months. Lameness from ED may subside when a dog reaches adulthood. The only way to confirm and evaluate ED is by x-ray. ED is less likely to be present in puppies born to parents who do not possess the condition. OFA certifies elbow radiographs and issues a certificate and registry number to dogs free of this disease. Knowing the elbow status of as many family members as possible helps breeders select dogs with a higher chance of producing puppies with normal elbows.</p>
                
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Bloat</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Bloat (gastric torsion and/or volvulus) is potentially life threatening and incredibly swift in onset. It is a condition that occurs when the stomach fills with gas and then may rotate. Immediate medical treatment, most likely emergency surgery, is mandatory and minutes, not hours, may save a life. Studies on this condition have revealed so many factors that precede bloating in dogs that no single cause can be named. Further studies are being conducted to better understand this disease and the ways of preventing it. Bloat has a very high morbidity rate. And dogs that bloat once have a higher tendency to do so again.</p>
                
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Hypothyroidism</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Hypothyroidism is a condition found fairly frequently in the breed. It can present itself via a variety of symptoms including hair coat changes (dryness, brittleness, brown pigmentation, sparseness) and changes in temperament. Dogs suffering from an under active thyroid can experience reproductive failure, and may put on excess weight even when fed a modest ration. A veterinarian can prescribe supplementation of thyroid hormone after a blood test is evaluated to determine whether the thyroid gland is working optimally. Heritability of these conditions is not understood entirely. This condition is usually easily treated with good results.</p>

                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Ottawa Humane Society</p>
                <p class="body-copy">The Ottawa Humane Society is a non-profit, community-based organization and a registered charity. We have a volunteer Board of Directors, drawn from our supporters and the community at large. Since 1888, we have been the leading organization providing a safe haven for sick, injured and homeless animals in Ottawa. For more information, read about the history of the Society. Each year, the Ottawa Humane Society rescues and cares for more than 10,000 animals in our community. For more about the breadth of our activities, please read our Annual Report.</p>
                
                <p class="about-issues-adopt-titles yotta">Friendly Giants Dog Rescue</p>
                <p class="body-copy"> Friendly Giants Dog Rescue is a non-profit group based in Ottawa with foster homes throughout Ontario, that was created by a network of people that became aware of the growing need to provide a safe haven and to find loving adoptive forever homes for dogs in pounds and shelters that would otherwise be euthanized. View our Code of Ethics document. Our rescue(FGDR) tends to work with large and giant breed dogs but we also take in highly adoptable dogs from high kill shelters in Canada. Most are seized from horrendous situations, while others come in as strays who are often abused and neglected. We do not take in owner surrenders as there are too many dogs in dire need, awaiting euthanization in these shelters across Canada. All of our rescues are fully vetted, spayed or neutered and are placed in foster homes as we do not operate a shelter environment. Therefore, they receive a lot of one-on-one attention and love to help them get over whatever bad experiences they may have had, to help them gain confidence, and to understand that not all humans are cruel. All our rescues are also assessed on temperment i.e. good with kids, cats dogs etc. in order to find the perfect forever home for them.  All a rescue dog looks for is a warm place to sleep, food in their bellies, and a kind loving family to shower them with attention. There is nothing more rewarding than looking a rescue dog in the eyes and seeing how much they appreciate a kind face, warm heart and the unconditional love they give back, no matter what circumstances they have come from.</p>
